Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions for creating an admin/employee page in your Laravel project:

Create a controller named EmployeeController by running the following command in your terminal:

php artisan make:controller Admin/EmployeeController

Open the EmployeeController.php file that was just created inside the app/Http/Controllers/Admin directory and add a method named index:


public function index()
{
    return view('admin.employee');
}

Create a blade view file named employee.blade.php inside the resources/views/admin directory. This is the view that will be returned by the index method of the EmployeeController:bash


touch resources/views/employee.blade.php   : in  terminal 


Inside the employee.blade.php file, add the HTML code that you want to display for the employee page.

Add a route for the admin/employee URL in the routes/web.php file:



Route::get('/admin/employee', [\App\Http\Controllers\Admin\EmployeeController::class, 'index'])
    ->middleware(['auth'])
    ->name('admin.employee');
    
Finally, add a link to the admin/employee page in your dashboard.blade.php file:


<a href="{{ route('admin.employee') }}">Employee Page</a>


That's it! Now you can access the admin/employee page by clicking the "Employee Page" link in your dashboard.blade.php file.


error : i am getting 

InvalidArgumentException
View [admin.employee] not found.
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/employee


This error occurs because Laravel is unable to find the admin.employee view file.

Here are a few things you can check:

Make sure that the employee.blade.php file is located in the correct directory: resources/views/admin/employee.blade.php.

Check the spelling and case of the view name in the EmployeeController file. It should be admin.employee:



public function index()
{
    return view('admin.employee');
}
Make sure that you have saved all the files and that there are no typos in your code.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you can try running the following command in your terminal to clear the cache:


php artisan view:clear


This will clear the compiled views and force Laravel to recompile them.



i have resources/views/employee.blade.php. create like this floder becouse i dont have admin inthat views folder 

If you don't want to use an admin folder for your views, you can simply change the name of the view in your EmployeeController:


public function index()
{
    return view('employee');
}

Make sure that the employee.blade.php file is located in the correct directory: resources/views/employee.blade.php.


Then, you can access the employee page by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/employee in your browser.
